# Findings

## [H-1] Overinflated rewards updated due to flaw in calling SablierV2ProxyTarget
### Summary
CouncilMember::_retrieve() is used to retrieve and distribute TELCOIN to council members based on the stream from _target. It uses a Sabiler PRBproxy to withdraw tokens to the CouncilMembers contract. The problem lies in not the wrong input parameter.

### Vulnerability Detail
The input parameter to call ISablierV2ProxyTarget::withdrawMax() implemented in CouncilMember::_retrieve() uses a proxy with an encoded selector. The call to the withdrawal will always not be executed because of the input variable using the wrong address.

```solidity
The ISablierV2ProxyTarget Line 74 etherscan
Implementation LoC

    function withdrawMax(
        ISablierV2Lockup lockup, // @audit require ISablierV2Lockup instance
        uint256 streamId,
        address to
    ) external;
```
### Impact
The call to the Sablier's Target will never be executed, hence overinflated rewards are updated to the users.

### Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-01-telcoin/blob/main/telcoin-audit/contracts/sablier/core/CouncilMember.sol#L270-L279C1
```solidity
    _stream.execute(
        _target,
        abi.encodeWithSelector(
            ISablierV2ProxyTarget.withdrawMax.selector,
            _target, //@audit wrong type
            _id,
            address(this)
        )
    );
    ```
### Tool used
Manual Review

### Recommendation
```diff
_stream.execute(
    _target,
    abi.encodeWithSelector(
        ISablierV2ProxyTarget.withdrawMax.selector,
--      _target,
++      ISablierV2Lockup(_target),
        _id,
        address(this)
    )
);
```
